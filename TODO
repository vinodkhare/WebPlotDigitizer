This is a brief TODO list for this project.

Features:

* Circular particle or arbitrary shape recognition. Just calculate the location of the centroid of the shape.
* Distance measurement tool.
* Edge detect filter.
* Live view of coordinates.
* Upload images even in the absence of FileReader API (IE, Safari, Opera) - this will require PHP/Flash :(

User Interface:

* Use drop down menu for Help.
* Convert top row of buttons to a better looking menu.
* Reduce the number of "popup" messages.
* Edit help section and provide an index to the video tutorials.
* Make things more intuitive.
